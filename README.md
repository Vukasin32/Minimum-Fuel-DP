# Minimum-Fuel-DP
This was a university assignment for the "Optimal Control" class. <br/>
Idea of project is to implement DP solution for car driving with minimum fuel consumption over 1000 meters. Start velocity is 5 km/h, end velocity is 67 km/h <br/> 
<br/>Technologies that were used:
* MATLAB
The problem is formulated and described in Chapter 8 of book:
* Allg√∂wer, F., Glielmo, L., Guardiola, C., Kolmanovsky, I., & Re, L. (Eds.). (2010). Automotive model predictive control: models, methods and applications. Springer. <br/>
